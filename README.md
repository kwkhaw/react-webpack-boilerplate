React Webpack Boilerplate
=====================

React project template with advanced Webpack setup based on [Pro React - Appendix A: Webpack for React](http://www.pro-react.com/materials/appendixA/).

### Usage

**Install**
```
npm install
```

**Start the application in development mode**
```
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Static files are served from the `public` folder, project JavaScript files are bundled from the `app` folder.

**When ready, build for production**
```
npm run build
```

This will generate a minimized bundle.js file on the `build` folder.
